# sph_compact_stars
Simulating a compact star using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with CUDA integration

graphing.m contains calls to bash to run the makefile and then generates the output. Variables can be adjusted inside f90 files and then recompiled.

One report was generated from this project which focuses on the parallelization of the code but includes information about the SPH implementation. Two presentations were also generated, one focusing on the parallelization with the other focusing more on the SPH implementation. 

Thanks to Phillip Mocz for algorithm help (https://pmocz.github.io/manuscripts/pmocz_sph.pdf).
